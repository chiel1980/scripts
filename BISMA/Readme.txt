A simple python script to generate a radar/spider graph based on the ISF SGOP 2022 categories.
Values ranging from 1 (No controls existent or not implemented) -> 5 (Fully demonstratable in control)

Showing 3 graphs: Company (Bol.com), Ambition of the company (Bol.com) and what the market standard is.

Tools needed to run this: Python 3 + Plotly (python3-plotly on Debian distro's) + a modern browser such as Firefox/Chromium

Run: python3 bisma.py #a browser tab will open with the plotted graph

Note: values given are random values to see if it works, they are not actual values for that specific company!
